# Rarities and B-Sides

These are things I wrote before I started keeping track of major pieces with this repo. This started with various internet posts, but I'm expanding it to anything I've written that has survived enough for me to be able to type it out. After all, everyone comes from somewhere, right?

I definitely lament that my comic reviews for *The Nerd Empire* did not survive in the Wayback Machine. Late-stage drafts may still be on my parents' computer, though.

I'm sure I'll also end up including things written after I started keeping track that I don't think are major enough to be numbered.

## Other places

Offhand, you can find my old Tumblr blog at [lethargilitic.tumblr.com](http://lethargilistic.tumblr.com/). It's mostly a journal of my time at the University of Washington, Tacoma, and has some posts from 2015 that document how terrible I was feeling during my final year.

I am also [a LibriVox reader](https://librivox.org/reader/12667).
