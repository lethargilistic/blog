# Rarities and B-Sides

These are things I posted around the Internet before I started keeping track of major pieces with this repo.

I definitely lament that my comic reviews for *The Nerd Empire* did not survive in the Wayback Machine. Late-stage drafts may still be on my parents' computer, though.

Offhand, you can find my old Tumblr blog at [lethargilitic.tumblr.com](http://lethargilistic.tumblr.com/). It's mostly a journal of my time at the Universit of Washington, Tacoma, and has some posts from 2015 that document how terrible I was feeling during my final year.

I'm sure I'll also end up including things written after I started keeping track that I don't think are major enough to be numbered.
