# Blue Book: "Life in the Iron Mills" and Slavery

*"Life in the Iron Mills" is the last story in the anthology we were reading out of, so these were probably written in December 2010. Beth Stevens gave me 100/100 for these Blue Book quiz answers. Of Part 2, she said "Very nicely done. Thorough and insightful.*

# Part 1: "Life in the Iron Mills"
Option 1

Rebecca Harding Davis's most famous work, "Life in the Iron Mills" is most assuredly a commentary on the then-recent technological advancements of the Industrial Revolution. At that time, America as a society began to move away from more agricultural pursuits like farming to the industrial, factories and the like. What people of the era did not readily acknowledge as much as they should have was the workers' treatment in these factories and Davis felt these oppressed sould needed a voice. Over the work, Davis stresses the dark scenery of her town, telling of the town's smoggy village saying, "It rolls sullenly in the slow folds from the great chimneys of the iron-foundaries, and settles down in black, slimy pools on the muddy streets" (1227). Davis's story was intensely relevant, shedding light on the workers' desperate situation and it is a shame that, though it was famed and acclaimed, it did not get the attention it readily deserved.

# Part 2: Slavery
Option 1

Both slaves, Frederick Douglass' and Harriet Jacobs' slave narratibes laid bare the issue of slavery for the average American. They illustrated their treatment, admitting they came from the northern section of the south and that blacks' conditions became sorely worse as one traveled southwards to the black belt and the Barbados Codes. Even between them, Jacobs, a loved slave for her "happy childhood" (805), and Douglass, a child whose condition was "very similar to that of the other slave children...not old enough to work in the field, and there being little else than field work to do, [he] had a lot of leasure time" (942), which he would fill, later, by educating himself. Though these narratives gleened new insights and interests to the slaves, the two arose from greatly dissimilar events.

When Jacob's mother died, she, at the age of six, first learned that she was owned. Before she was treated kindly and lived with her birth mother, younger brother, and grandmother. She was owned, however, by a woman who grew up as her Jacobs's mother's foster sister. This woman treated her kindly and taught her to read and write before she also passed away. Jacobs was given to a small girl, whose father took control of her and had threw fits of rage which resulted in, at one time, "...a stunning blow" (809) and the shaving of her head at another. She would escape and hide in a crawlspace of her grandmother's attic for seven years, a hole "nine feet long and seven feet wide...highest part was three feet high" (Jacobs 818) before she alighted north dressed as a male sailor, only to be freed years later by writ of her young mistress, now a woman.

Douglass was well liked by his initial owner anad, while Jacobs focused mainly on herself, he related the trials and killings of other slaves while detailing grievoud objections to their treatments, those being his lack of a bed, "My feet have been so cracked with frost, that the pen with which I am now writing might be laid in the gashes," (942) and their lack of decent food. Douglass's condition, instead of deteriorating as Jacobs' had, grew better as he was moved up north, where "[a] city slave is almost a free man, compared with a slave on a plantation," though that would change as well when he was sent to a reeducation plantation. It was there he pondered and came to realize that education was important, but also that it killed his soul to know he was treated so differently but that he was also human, not something to be owned. He would also go north dressed as a sailor and would go on to be an abolitionist orator.
