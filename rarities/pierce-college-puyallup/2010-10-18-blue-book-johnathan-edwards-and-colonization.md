# Blue Book: Johnathan Edwards and Colonization

*This was a Blue Book exam from my first quarter in college, taking American Literature I under Beth Stevens. It dovetailed extremely well with my American History I class that quarter, which also covered the colonial period, which I think influenced Part 2.*

*I feel a bit like a broken record, saying this of most of my teachers, but she was very nice and I remember adoring her class. It was the first time I really dug into primary sources from colonial American history, and I found it fascinating. Of her, I remember, of all things, that she refused to assign* Moby Dick *for student reading because she hated it and that she named one of her children "Hunter." Of all things.*

*This quiz probably had us choose from a number of prompts to write two responses. Part 1 is about Johnathan Edwards, a preacher famous for his "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" metaphor. Part 2 is about Colonization. Beth wrote a number of encouraging "yes!" and "exactly!" comments throughout, concluding "overdeveloped, but excellent" on Part 1 and "very, very nicely developed, presented" on Part 2. I got full marks, so I included it in my high school portfolio as an example of my Running Start college work.*

*The textual citations are to* The Norton Anthology of American Literature Volume 1 (Shorter Seventh Edition) *edited by Nina Baym, if you care about that sort of thing.*

*I don't believe I ever had another class that asked us to use Blue Books for tests.* (2019-01-06, before transcription)

*It's kind of refreshing at this point to read something I wrote about history that wasn't* horrifically *racist, although it could be improved. I'll noote here specifically that calling the European colonizers "settlers" as opposed to the Native Americans biases us in favor of seeing the colonizers as in the right. The land was already "settled" by Native American "settlers." While I don't engage in calling it "stolen land," myself, there's a whole history that is minimized and erased by our default language on this subject. Read* Lies My Teacher Told Me.* 

*I did a lot of brackets and quote-mangling to make my points back then, though I was always true to what they were saying. I remember using brackets to decapitalize words. Completely unnecessary.*

*Although the core of the last paragraph is true enough, its left turn into outright apologia for the colonists is the sort of distressing thing I was hoping this would have avoided. Oh well. Disavowed, at least that part.* (2019-01-06, during transcription)

## Part 1: Johnathan Edwards

1)  
Johnathan Edward's most famous metaphor from his most famous sermon, "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" is his comparison of individuals to a spider on a thread held by God. He believed that "[people] hang by a slender thread, with the flames of divine wrath flashing it, and ready every moment to singe it, and burn it asunder" (Edwards 200) and that "[a person is] held over in the hand of...God, whose wrath is provoked and incensed as much against you as against many of the damned in hell" (Edwards 200). This piece is absolutely representative of Edwards, though most do not see it in proper context. When this fiery sermon is read alongside another of his works, *Personal Narrative*, his true meaning can be discerned. In this lesser known work, Edwards described his ponderings as he walked through the street, many times weeping at his thoughts. He walked with the phrase "Infinite upon Infinite" (Edwards 179) on his lips most often. When looking at himself, he "[took] view of [his] wickedness, [and] it looked like an abyss deeper than hell" (Edwards 179). He believed that in God's eye, he appeared "sunk down in [his] sins infinitely below hell itself, far beyond the light of everything..." (Edwards 179), and he was a minister. If God looked upon him so lowly, he must have imagined many times worse of his congregation's fate and expressed it through the spider analogy.

## Part 2: Colonization

3)  
In the 17th Century, England's colonization efforts in North America began in earnest. When settlers arrived at Jamestown in 1609 and Plymouth in 1720, they found great forests and beautiful scenery. In the dense foliage lived many civilizations, characterized by explorer Christopher Columbus as the Indians, but would much more often be known at that time as simply savages. Because they had not developed in the vein of Britain and other European countries, the whites branded them such, labeling themselves civilized to place themselves above these hut dwellers. The name was used to degrade them, but with the hindsight of 400 years, we see similarities between the settlers and those John Smith observed performing a ritual and wrote of it "With most strange gestures and passions be[sic] began his invocation...which done, three more devils come in with ["hellish voices and a rattle in [their] hand[s]"], painted half black, half red..." (51).] This dichotomy can most easily be read from the difference in religion, the natives preferring animism to the settlers' Christian beliefs.

While Indians like Red Jacket, though he lived long after initial settlement, simply wished to live in peace and practice their religion in peace, rituals and all. The Europeans would have none of it and would try to force their beliefs on the people. The newcomers feared that any uprooting of their Christian system would be dangerous to them, and though, as Jacket once said, "[they did] not wish to destroy your religion or take it from [them]" (216), the settlers' views would lead to violence among the two groups, further preventing any kind of understanding between the groups. However, the Europeans did have good intentions behind their small-minded treatment of the Indians.

Following their belief that they were civilized, they brought to them a view of the world counter to theirs that believed if Indians did not believe as they did, the natives would be forever damned to suffer the "fierceness and wrath of Almighty God...all eternity." They wanted to spare them of that but their views placing themselves above the Indians stunted this process and leaves the people of today with a negative history and negative views of the "civilized" settlers.
