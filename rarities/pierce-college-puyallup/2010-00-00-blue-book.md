# Part 1: "Life in the Iron Mills"
Option 1

Rebecca Harding Davis's most famous work, "Life in the Iron Mills" is most assuredly a commentary on the then-recent technological advancements of the Industrial Revolution. At that time, America as a society began to move away from more agricultural pursuits like farming to the industrial, factories and the like. What people of the era did not readily acknowledge as much as they should have was the workers' treatment in these factories and Davis felt these oppressed sould needed a voice. Over the work, Davis stresses the dark scenery of her town, telling of the town's smoggy village saying, "It rolls sullenly in the slow folds from the great chimneys of the iron-foundaries, and settles down in black, slimy pools on the muddy streets" (1227). Davis's story was intensely relevant, shedding light on the workers' desperate situation and it is a shame that, though it was famed and acclaimed, it did not get the attention it readily deserved.

Option 1

Both slaves, Frederick Douglass' and Harriet Jacobs' slave narratibes laid bare the issue of slavery for the average American. They illustrated their treatment, admitting they came from the northern section of the south and that blacks' conditions became sorely worse as one traveled southwards to the black belt and the Barbados Codes. Even between them, Jacobs, a loved slave for her "happy childhood" (805), and Douglass, a child whose condition was "very similar to that of the other slave children...not old enough to work in the field, and there being little else than field work to do, [he] had a lot of leasure time" (942), which he would fill, later, by educating himself. Though these narratives gleened new insights and interests to the slaves, the two arose from greatly dissimilar events.
