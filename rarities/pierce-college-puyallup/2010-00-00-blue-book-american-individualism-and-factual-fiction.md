# Blue Book: American Individialism and Factual Fiction
Another blue book from Beth Stevens' *American Literature I* class. I think it's the last one I have, and it was loose among my papers from school. It didn't make it into my high school portfolio because I didn't finish either prompt I was given. ...And, yet, I still got a 93/100? 

Beth wrote of the first response "beautiful ideas&mdash;articulate, insightful, & thorough," then "really, overdeveloped&mdash;control your ideas..." (31/33)

Of the second, "great line of discussion," then "seems like you might have run out of time..." (62/67) (2019-01-19, before transcription)

Does anyone else read things that you wrote ten years ago and feel justified in time traveling to kill yourself? Writing this cliche-filled and bad... (2019-01-19, before transcription)

(Part 1 was so bad, I took a break and didn't get back to this for almost a month.) Part 2 takes a quite racist turn in an otherwise kind of interesting point I'd forgotten. A lot of the Revolutionary Generation's works that I've heard of because they've remained somewhat famous tend to be histories of what happened. They no doubt doubled as marketing for the American experiment in general. (2019-02-05)

## Part 1: American Individualism
1)  
From our country's inception, we have glorified and honored those who brought it into beng, from George Washington to Thomas Jefferson. They lead the people a great rebellion that shook the world to its core and would shape the center of the american psyche, impacting Americans to this day. Americans love rebels. This permeates into all aspects of our production, especially or literary culture, producing some of the most prodigious writers the world has ever known, leaving their marks with an undeniably American twist, proclaiming our defiance in the face of those who proclaim people must be the same as all others. Washington Irving's famed short story "Rip Van Winkle" told of the titular character's marriage to a shrew of a woman. The every man just wished to be alone to do what he loved. This is a great tenet of American life as it is a place where the individual is praised and when a person's wishes to have personal activity is denied, Americans rally behind them. All he wished to do was "...sit on a rock, with a rod as long and heavy as a Tartar's lance, and fish all day without a murmur..." (Irving 457). On that same coin, we want to be able to think as we please, something which another great writer of Irving's time, Ralph Waldo Emerson, stressed in his his defense of American scholarship, "The American Scholar." He believed that listening to the ways of how the Europeans thought was futile&mdash;we had already declared our separation from them&mdash;and that though "[t]he spirit of the American freeman is already suspected to be timid, imitable, [and] tame" (Emerson 532), we are "a nation, of men [that] for the first time exist[s], because each believes himself inspired by the" Divine Soul which also inspires all men. These two embody the free thinking, financially universal belief system that americans can be as they want to be.

## Part 2: American Factual Fiction
3)
With the advent of Washington Irving's short stories, America began to find itself a new niche in the literary world. While most things to come from the budding nation and most written of it were didactic in nature, times following Irving's "Rip Van Winkle" were littered with proseful fiction, and that mindset generally remains today. However, while it was not always so, America was predestined to become a lover of powreful fictitious works from the time of its initial and most basic settlement.

The non-fiction tales of America's colonial period were produced largely for two reasons, to record the momentous era for future generations, as was the case with William Bradford's history of Plymouth Plantation, or to encourage others to join them in the New World. The latter would inspire many wonderous works designed to relay the continent's natual serenity and beautiful surroundings. This falls more in line with John Smith's *General History of Virginia, New England, and the Summer Isles*, which includes a captivating account of his experiences with the country's Indian populations. The events most assuredly did not occur exactly as Smith transposed, comprising of exciting narrative elements such as when Smith "...bound [his Indian] guide to his arm by his garters and used him as a buckler" (48) when accosted by upwards of 200 hostile Indians. Smith's narration would prove successful, garnering him fame and would inspire many men and women to journey to America for the adventures the transition would bring.

This spirit was not lost on Irving, by bringing a non-fictional sense to his "Winkle," claiming that "[the] Tale was found among the papers of the late Diedrich Knickerbocker," (455), he harkens back to the idea that things based in the fact of the times gain more appreciation, a definite callback to Smith's work.
