# Author Biography: John Steinbeck

*The paper itself is undated, but the research materials printed and stapled to the back are dated 2009-11-03 and 2009-11-02. It's from 10th Grade Pre-AP Sophomore English. My clearest memory of that class is reading next to my friend, John Hopkins. He read faster than anyone else I'd ever met, though he might be outdone by professional scholars I've met since.*

*Ms. Coombs was a very nice teacher. Once, she had us try to relate to Shakespearian plays that we had to recite by having us create boxes of physical objects related to the story. I chose *Henry V*, and chose two obvious things. Having run out of ideas for a third, I made a very bold play: I stuffed a (cleaned) wine bottle in the box and held it up in front of the whole class. They were shocked. She let me get away with it, hahaha. I recited the "Band of Brothers" speech, using a mechanical pencil for a sword and sporting my inveterate pleather jacket. I hammed it up; it was great. Other people got to borrow a stage sword from my 9th Grade teacher, Mrs. McKenzie, but it wasn't available on my day.*

*She gave me full marks for this, so I included it in my student portfolio (a gripe for another day) with the caption "This Author Biography was Mrs.[sic] Coombs's (this was Mrs. Struna's name before she was somewhat recently married) favorite out of the class. Ms. Coombs praised me very highly for my research aptitude and my ability to organize my thoughts: both of which are very important to a prospective Software Engineer and a person dealing with adult life, which must always be considered as it's the only stone-set aspect of all out future lives." I have a tab here, so I called it out during the presentation, which determined whether or not I could graduate because the Portfolio project was so blatantly abusive.

*I haven't read any Steinbeck since high school. I enjoyed *Of Mice and Men* quite a bit, but *The Pearl* was dreadful. My copy of *Mice* is currently in my "to donate" pile of books after a move.* (2019-01-06, before transcribing)

*This fairly representative of my high school writing. Run-on sentences about, cramming in every little detail with conjoining phrases like "as well as."*

*If the paragraphs seem like they don't transition well enough between each other, that's because each paragraph had a different topic prescribed by the rubric. Introduction, Early/Family Life, Professional Life, Conclusion, Your Opinion.*

*Okay, 2009 Mike, you don't to kiss Steinbeck's ass that much. You read like two novels.* (2019-01-06, during transcribing)

"He's gonna beat hell outta you with a stick, that's what he's gonna do," said the cotton tailed rabbit from the imagination of the tragic Lenny, a strong-armed farm hand. He, a character from the famed novella *Of Mice and Men* by the author of such other books as *East of Eden* and *The Pearl*, finds himself despaired by the river, contemplating his recent actions and worrying about his friend George's reaction to the point of hallucination. The person behind this man's plight is John Steinbeck, a true American author from the era of the Great Depression. Through the writer's works and commentaries on the world made during his yound life, as well as in his later days, he inspired and inspires many people well past his death.

John Steinbeck was born to John Steinbeck Sr. and his wife, Olive Hamilton on February 27, 1902 in Salinas, California. While the future writer's father worked as the Monterey County Treasurer, he would work as a farmhand and food picker to make money. At the same time, he realized his budding talent for writing, a field he was encouraged by his mother, a former chool teacher, to further explore during his days at Salinas High School. He went on to attend Stanford University sporadically between 1919 and 1925, though he did not take a degree when he left the institution.

Further inspired by his mother, as well as his innate flair for manipulating the written word, Steinbeck decided to pursue a career in writing as a means to further support himself as he worked odd jobs to earn a living during the Depression of the 1920s and 1930s. His experience as a farmhand during his youth and this period, specifically his encounters with migrant workers of the era, as well as his friendship with a marine biologist named Ed Ricketts all heavily impacted his works as an author. Steinbeck and Ricketts even wrote a book together, though it was primarily scientific, the narrative of which was later rereleased under only Steinbeck's name as *The Log from the Sea of Cortez*. This writer even incorporated scenery from his childhood and experiences to illustrate varied and beautiful landscapes in his stories.

John Steinbeck wrote many excellent novels and crafted countless enthralling chronicles over his lifetime, up until his heath from heart diseas on December 20, 1968. His books have inspired me to think of my less-than-complicated life with more perspective. They also shine a light on the underpublicized lifestyles of providers, and even simply survivors, during the Great Depression. He truly defines himself from the crowd of other writers of his time and those of today. His characters displayed infinite layers of depth and morality, even sin, while other authors simply caricature great evil or unselfish righteousness.

As for my personal opinion of the man, John Steinbeck is one of the most excellent writers I've ever had the pleasure of reading. His works should be read by everyone. If Steinbeck were still alive, however, I would advise him to describe his characters a bit more but that, in essence, is one of his most telling literary fingerprints.
