# Starting a blog!

*This is the first post on my old tumblr blog, which currently sits at lethargilistic.tumblr.com and which lethargilistic.com used to redirect to. I started it because of the meme that aspiring programmers should have a blog to show to prospective employers. It's a toxic idea, in hindsight, but if I recall correctly, I talked a lot about my early exploration of MOOCs, programming, and my friendship with Summer White, someone who I've since lost touch with, but whose friendship I valued very highly.*

*I used some janky service to post this originally, but moved to tumblr for the second post because it was an easy setup and I had some friends who used it.*

*This was before I started openly using my name on the Internet, but more-than-likely after I had compromised that pseudoanonymity.*

*I believe the "political book" was* Broke *by Glenn Beck. I was once a fan of his, but am no longer. I had stopped following him closely even by this point and buying that book second-hand was basically for old time's sake, but I remember reading about his coverage of the Boston Marathon bombing sometime after it happened and distancing myself from him completely. He accused an innocent man of being a third member of the bombing team on-air, basically. (2018-11-21)*

Hello there, my handle is lethargilistic, and it’s my dream to be a game programmer. I have only the vaguest idea of how to do that at this point, so I feel like I need to organize my thoughts. I may not be able to control all this information that I’m bombarding myself with daily, but I can control how I handle it. Besides that, my browser bookmarks are getting kinda crowded. ^^’

So a little bit about me: you can call me Leth, for short. The ‘l’ in the full name is never capitalized, but always capitalized in “Leth.” I have a two-year degree in engineering and physics and I plan to attend a computer science program at the local university at my first opportunity. I’m a bit of a slacker, but when I put my mind to things I can do very well. Any description of myself I could give you would sound fairly generic, but I do take some pride in my pink shoelaces.

I know a lot of fairly basic C++, and am currently learning from a book that I’ve enjoyed so far (don’t ask how old it is…it’s pretty old, but it was cheap). I tend to like reading tutorials from books instead of online, at least when it comes to things I want to remember, for a number of reasons. I could probably write a post like that.

I also know the Music Macro Language, which makes for a good distraction sometimes.

I’m in the middle of many books at this point, including *Code Complete* by Steve McConnell, *The Mythical Man-Month* by Frederick Brooks, *Fragile Things* by Neil Gaiman, and a political book that would probably make half of you stop reading my blog right here. Don’t worry, my politics won’t come into the equation for this research blog (hopefully).
