The thesis of *Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann*, a 2007 anime, is that anyone can affect whatever change they want in their life by applying a strong enough combination of confidence, brute force, teamwork, and love to their dreams, regardless of a person's personal characteristics. As this show is also primarily about the lives and motivations of men, thematically, it oozes overly-aggressive, assertive forms of masculinity from every pore. Almost all of the male characters within it embrace shows of great physical prowess as true symbols of manhood, except one: Leeron. He never fights in a battle directly, and serves as the team scientist and main mechanic. He is also very effeminate, drawn without defined muscles, and speaks with a higher-pitched drawl. Leeron is an interesting portrayal of an unconventional masculine figure because, while it might appear that he is the antithesis of how the show wants to portray men, he really embodies this show’s message.  

Leeron dedicates himself to science and engineering and proves his worth to the group by applying these skills instead of martial ones. The other members of Team Gurren, who are never portrayed as great intellects, turn to him for advice in these areas and they value his input as an integral member of the team. Were it not for him, they would not have understood the motivations of the Anti-Spirals before going to fight them (Video 1). That scene is a clear demonstration of the difference between Leeron and the rest of Team Gurren. They drool while he explains the technical details and they need him to relate to them and put the situation in terms they understand, and they can count on him to do that. 

He also judges others and the world through a lens he developed while deciding how to live. At the beginning, when Kamina steals Gurren from the Beastmen, we are shown reactions from the Yoko, Daiyakka, and Leeron (Video 2). Daiyakka and Yoko are impressed by the physical act, calling it “overkill” and “pretty cool.” However, Leeron was impressed by their ingenuity. This becomes even more significant when we get a brief glimpse into Leeron’s life from before he left his village for the surface. He was a “hereditary guard” who “could barely read.” He found his calling and, by dedicating himself to learning it, he became a great figure in the world. He surpassed all kinds of boundaries he saw before himself and helped save the world. 

 Leeron defined his own way of living in the world as a man and chooses to act it out confidently, unafraid to be forceful about it with those around him (Video 2). He used it to make himself an asset to his team and he expressed his love for all of the members of Team Gurren, and earned their respect. In this way, Leeron is both provided as a validation of the show’s thesis at the start and is shown to viewer as a necessary counterpoint to the show’s portrayal of masculine figures. Gurren Lagann means it when it says “the one thing you choose yourself: that is the truth of your universe,” even if you don’t choose to become its own “paragon of total masculinity,” represented in this show by drills (Video 4). After all, Leeron didn’t, and he had already found “what [his] drill was meant to do” and accepted himself as an effeminate engineer, represented by his gyroscope, before the universe-threatening apocalypse. 


*[a/n: The videos were in iframes to show up on the online discussion forum. It seems like Hulu doesn't have TTGL at the same locations, but I'm leaving the links anyway. They have the number of seconds from the beginning of whatever episode it is at the ends.]*
