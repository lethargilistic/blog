# Moving over to Tumblr

*Yes, even then, I had trouble updating anything regularly. Shocker, I know. (2018-11-21)*

Well, I realized the place I was initially going to keep my learning blog had a terrible interface and I knew I was going to have to move or face conversing with myself negatively.

Down that path is never updating. And sadness. So a fortuitous coincidence occurred to save the day. I’m currently working through a basic [game design course](https://www.open2study.com/courses/concepts-in-game-development) through Open2Study. It’s limited, it’s quick, and it lacks a lot of meat, but I’m enjoying it and I’m learning new stuff. If I only had those reasons, that’d be enough, but it’s also cool to see some physical techniques that could be used in the trade. They’re simple, but I rather like the concepts, and it gets me looking at things in a different light than I normally would.

Anyway, I’m taking this online course and I take a look at the forums under the videos and I find a link to another user, who I click on a whim. His profile lead to a game design blog, and he was using [Tumblr](https://summerstudys.tumblr.com/)! I practically went mad from the realization. Tumblr as an actual blog? Not just pictures? WHY THE HECK NOT? So here I am, testing the waters. I’ll probably be greatly influenced by that user while creating this thing, so I’ll have to be sure to thank him for the idea some time. One thing I’ll be sure to crib is keeping track of the number of hours I’ve spent studying in each header. That’s simple but absolutely brilliant.
