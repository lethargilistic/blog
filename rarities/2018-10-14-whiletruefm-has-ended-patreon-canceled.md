# *whiletruefm* has ended, Patreon canceled

*The letter I sent to the whiletruefm patrons when I announced the show's cancellation. Sad day.*

Hi,

I recorded the last episode of the show at the end of September and meant to shut down the patreon then, but Patreon is horribly designed. Because it was the first time I took money out of the account, it forced me to wait 10 days to get it. Now it's telling me that I can't just turn off collections: I have to set this account to patron-only, which means the creator page probably isn't going to be archived for posterity. Considering it's advising me to download the payment data for tax purposes, I expect everything to be wiped. This is deeply irritating from an archival perspective.

Anyway, I'm not going to record any more regular episodes. In short, my anxiety problems have been acting up more and more as I approached and then passed a year of unemployment. I work best on a team, and after the others moved on, making the show became as joyless for me as a solo programming project. I work best when I can bounce off others and share creative energy. In the absence of that, I'm kind of dead in the water; what can I say? I did try attracting interviews, but they fell through, so I'm just going to call it.

In long, this is what the last episode is about, so you'll hear whatever I said about it if I can bring myself to finish that one of these days. I've been prioritizing an audiobook project dedicated to a late friend of mine recently, which coincidentally also started off as a group project and has become a solo affair.

Thanks for supporting the show for its run! I'm sorry I couldn't make that many solo episodes and for letting the Patreon run. (That 10 day delay pushed me past the October collection day, so if this is upsetting, please be one month less upset with me. ^^;)
