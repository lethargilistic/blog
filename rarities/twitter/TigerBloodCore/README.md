# @TigerBloodCore (Chuck Tigre-Ramirez)

This Twitter account was part of a big *Portal 2* RP scene that I was tertiarily involved with back in 2011.

I first joined Twitter to stay in touch with my friend, Pentharis, and she was involved with this group in a bigger way. 
She made the picture used for this account and a few of the other cores, such as Maternity Core.
I still have the original of that piece tucked away in the back of my ISP portfolio from high school.

This account was a parody of the Charlie Sheen flameout that was happening at about the same time. I never even followed that closely,
so the account probably wasn't even very true to it other than #WINNING and such. It was a dumb joke I did for a day and we laughed.
At its height, the account had about 50 followers, which was when I had 80.
