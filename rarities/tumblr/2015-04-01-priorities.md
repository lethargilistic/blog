*The person who was murdered was [Daniel Mosley](https://q13fox.com/2016/03/25/murder-mystery-help-get-justice-for-family-of-daniel-mosley-gentle-giant-gunned-down-by-drive-by-shooter/).
I had known him for years, though we hung out in different circles and weren't close. We were both on the golf team in high school. His death shook me, especially considering where he was
going in life. He was going to get married and have kids with a nice woman, and hopefully leave our neighborhood. I remember going to his wake, one of the nights immediately
after this, and they had cameras set up in case the killer came by to gloat. People spoke, we burned candles, and dedicated a cross to mark
the spot where he died that's still there. Someone played a ukelele solo for him. Easton, whom I had broken the news to over Skype earlier,
talked about how he was so sick of his friends dying. Devona and Ashlee were there. Eric Lanoue had me hold his candle and I placed it on
Daniel's memorial because I had to leave. Of course, I immediately ran into him after having done so, and I've always been sorry about that.
When I go by that intersection, I see that cross is still decorated sometimes.*

*Completely unrelated, although time limits* were *on my mind, I told the woman I was interested in at the time how I felt that night. 
She didn't reject me. I was ecstatic about that, weak knees and smiles and everything. It did not go well. April 2015 was Hell, and to this
day it frustrates me that I can't really have an open conversation about it. We didn't talk for over a year, and have since reconciled,
though it's not the same as it was between us.* (2019-01-05)

So today I woke up to news that an acquaintance of mine from school was murdered two minutes from here on Monday night. I didn’t actually know what had happened for a while, but that was a shock. Then I read the news later, and the details are just dreadful. We weren’t close or even friends, really, but he was a good, decent guy. That’s the best word I have to describe him really: decent. I certainly wasn’t, back at Washington High. He was someone who should have been around longer than 20 years. The person who killed him is trash, and I hope they’re locked up.

Just goes to show that tomorrow could be it for anybody. I looked up some internships to apply to, at Adobe, T-Mobile, and Amazon. In Seattle. Suddenly, I don’t particularly care what city a potential internship is in, as long as it’s a step to getting out of here.

We had our first day of Operating Systems. It was a neat, high level discussion about what an operating system is and what they’re responsible for: managing software/hardware resources and giving programmers an interface to the hardware.
