# On Book Smarts

*It bugs me when people say they can't start learning how to program. Because of how locked-down my computer was when I started 
learning, I read books to start trying to understand before I could do anything. I definitely wouldn't recommend exactly that, 
because it was a necessary evil in my case, but you don't need the latest, greatest version of everything to start exploring a 
new topic.*

*Shout-out to my college engineering teacher, Ken Schroeder, who gifted me my first programming book sometime in 2012-2013.
It was* Starting Out with Games & Graphics in C++, 2nd Edition *by Tony Gaddis. If you want to start learning how to make games,
as I did, do not start by learning C++. Get to making games as quickly as possible.*

Because there’s an implicit difference between reading about something (poorly termed as “book smarts”) and knowing something. If you read a Calc book without doing problems in it, you might understand the concepts of Differentiation and Integration, but you won’t actually be able to apply them.

To put it in programming terms, I read through my first book on C++ before I could get a compiler on my computer. When I finally could, I couldn’t program much at all and basically had to restart. That kind of thing.

Though, “book smarts” is poorly termed because people latch onto the “book” part and the term implies, as you say, that’s not useful. But of course reading is useful. It’s a major way we learn. A better term would be something “shallow learning.” And, ideally, it would be followed by constructive criticism about how to retain and use information better, something “book smarts” seeming never is.
