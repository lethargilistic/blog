# A Rhyme For Theoretical Physicists

*Turns out I had a second tumblr blog, called lethcasual. 
I was semi-serious about trying to be productive about it back then, I guess. 
I didn't use it much, though. IIRC, I didn't find that many interesting blogs to follow
because I was never so much into the fandom content. This is a parody of a song sung in a bar in* Tangled.

*I used to do these a lot more, but most are lost because I posted them in chatrooms like Fanvale.
My favorite was a parody of "All Along the Watchtower" about joining up with Strexcorp.
The line "All Aboard the Strexcorp Train" still pops in my head from time to time. I loved, loved, 
loved Strexcorp when I was into* Welcome to Night Vale *several years ago. I remember doing a little RP session on my 
first night in Fanvale where I was a Strex employee where threatening to give Sammy a heart monitor, courtesy of Strex.
She "noped out." It was great. That was how we met. I remember that I misgendered Jayce as a girl that night, too, lol.*

"I finished my verse!"

*Begins to sing*

“I’m metic'late, neat, though barely,  
With functions I never tarry,  
And physics-wise, did Flynn not land there safely?  
Yet because unkempt I look,  
And ‘cause my nose looks like a crook’s,  
They say I can’t get my "Peach”-Dee [Ph D.] in physics.  

Can’t you see me at my desk studying Carnot, pondering atomic mass or steam?  
Yep, I’d like to be there steadly  
crunching numbers at the 'versity.  
Despite all of their jeers, I’ve got a dream!"
