# Can Stress Make Me Sleepy?

*Fuck my parents. Moving back in with them for a year in 2018 was dreadful. They just continued to wreck my state of mind and treat
my like dirt. I could have written this again right now, three-and-a-half years later: "And that’s really the problem, and why I have to go: my life is going to be lead according to my plan. It already has been for some time, but I won’t grow as a person if I’m forced to live with people who think they have the same control over me that they did when I was younger."*

*Basically, when someone demonstrates to you that they're a piece of shit, believe them the first time. Believe them the first 
twenty years worth of times.* (2019-01-05)

Today, I went to Databases, where we talked about creating constraints on tables. I was having trouble staying awake, which is a pattern now and troubling.

After that, I went and talked to the school’s industry liaison about job hunting and my resume. He had a lot of interesting advice and I do feel like the changes I’ve made have been beneficial. I spoke to my Networking teacher about the same, and she gave me some good advice, too. I’m going to expand the information on my projects so that I don’t need to have a separate section for a boring list of technologies I know.

I took my final exam for Networking and believe I did well enough. I should pass.

I went home, early even, and started working on a problem set my Databases teacher gave us for homework and fell asleep almost immediately. This is really concerning. What’s also concerning is that I’m writing this at 3AM because I can’t get to sleep. I think this is being brought on by stress.

My move has been delayed for most of the month, but we finally got all of the paperwork sorted on Tuesday and should be approved to move in by the end of the week. So I talked to my mom about what in my room my parents consider theirs. This sparked an argument. It didn’t have to, but my parents believe that me moving out is a mistake, and my mother can be a very poisonous person when things don’t go exactly according to her plan. And that’s really the problem, and why I have to go: my life is going to be lead according to my plan. It already has been for some time, but I won’t grow as a person if I’m forced to live with people who think they have the same control over me that they did when I was younger.

What was worse, though, was when my nephew chimed in against me moving out. He is a few months younger than me, so he’s more like a little brother to me, and he butts into business that doesn’t concern him, accordingly. He was saying the same things that my parents were: that it would be more expensive to live than I think, that I can’t trust the people I’m moving in with. My nephew’s conception of how much it costs to live is, in fact, different than mine. He has an old car that requires a lot of maintenance. That is very expensive. He has a woodworking hobby that he wants to be his career. That is very expensive. I don’t have either of those concerns. I am a programmer. I’m currently writing on the machine I use for development. All the things I need are a place to live, electricity, and internet, the cost of all of which will be split three ways. I’ll also be getting my own phone plan soon, and I can get an inexpensive option for that since I rarely call people.

You know what kind of logic I’m dealing with here? “Mike, what is your plan if they don’t come through on the rent?” “I have enough savings to pay the rent on my own.” “So you’ll just be a patsy!” As if the rent not getting paid was an option, somehow. As if me having a plan to respond to their concerns was insufficient or wrong. Furthermore, I’ve known both of the people I’m moving in with for at least 10 years, and they have never shirked anyone on money issues before. I even made a plan in spite of that because I’m careful.

They think I’m stupid, and they have said so constantly since I announced this decision in response to the final straw pinning me to the couch after years of putting me down and lording over me. I am not stupid. I just wish the people I live with wouldn’t embody all of my complaints while trying to convince me to stay.

I woke up in the evening and finished most of the Database homework. I ran into an issue with a correlated subquery that I’m shelving for the moment.
