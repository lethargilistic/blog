# Took an Interview Test; Didn’t Do Great
*Fuck programming interviews and fuck people who think inspiring thinking like* this *is beneficial to junior programmers looking for jobs. The questions they asked me, whatever they were, had nothing to do with the job at hand and they knew it. Discrete math.* CTCI. *Fuck off. None of this contributed to or was meant to contribute to me being a better programmer or ["deserving" of being a programmer.](../0007-you-deserve-to-be-a-software-engineer.md)* (2020-07-01)

Since I’ll be graduating soon, I need to learn to get in front of other people and code for technical interviews. I took one online just now and it didn’t go as well as I was hoping. I choked, really. So now I need to look at things I can do better for next time.

## Before taking another test like this, I need to practice my discrete math.
Every question was math related, and I honestly wasn’t prepared for that. I should have been, since I expected something like that, but I didn’t go over any exercises before starting the test. My rustiness in discrete math concepts and dynamic programming showed immediately.

## I need to write more down.
Trying to do the abstract math in my head gave me a headache and made me more nervous. It’s not like I didn’t have paper and a pen nearby, but I really only took notes for one of the questions.

What happened to my engineering training? Given, Sketch, Data, Find, Solution and all that? I think I’ve gotten out of that good habit since programming problems tend to be too squirrelly for that kind of waterfall approach as an end-to-end method, but it’s still a great way to gather requirements.

## I need to read the question more thoroughly.
I wasted some time by misreading one of the questions early on. It was very demoralizing, especially since I actually had the correct goal at first and it was a follow-up reading that confused me. Of course, this is what source control is for, but that’s no excuse.

## Do I need to read *Cracking the Coding Interview?*
I’ve had this book recommended to me a number of times, and I’ve done some of its exercises in a group setting during Woman in Computer Science meetings (our club is open to everyone).

On the one hand, doing so would get me back to being more comfortable with straight-up math programming questions again. Unambiguous win on that front.

On the other, would it be unfair for me to go into a programming interview knowing optimal solutions to problems off the top of my head? I mean simply reciting them. But, then, I could say that I know the answer to a particular question (not in this particular case, but in most others). And I categorically don’t memorize that way, anyway. That might just be a baseless concern.

Even so, I also don’t want to pick up another book at the moment. I still need to move and consolidate my collection as it is, and that’s $30+ that can go to rent or setting up with my roommates. It might be a good long-term investment, sure, but in the short-term it doesn’t make much sense.

## Overall, be humble, not nervous.
I got a little caught up in trying to impress at points, which was a mistake. My code got messy because of it, and taking leaps to solutions didn’t get me any closer. It just threw back the wrong answers in my face and made me feel silly and sweatier.

I can program my way out of a paper bag. I just have to remember that I don’t need a flamethrower to do that.
