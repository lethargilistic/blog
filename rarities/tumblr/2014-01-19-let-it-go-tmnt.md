# Let It Go: TMNT

*I'm pretty sure booyakasha123 was my buddy from Fanvale, Jayce. Very much into* Teenaged Mutant Ninja Turtles,
*and we talked about the show a bunch while Fanvale was still around. I think this poem originated in that Skype group.*

Wind chills fast in the city tonight.  
Not a brother to be seen.  
A borrough of isolation, and it looks like I’m the king.  
My hem is flapping like this swirling storm inside.  
Couldn’t take it off.  
Heaven knows I’ve tried.  

“Don’t wear that bra.”  
“No tiaras.”  
“Be the leader you always have to be.”  
“Sequins, shadows they just don’t mix.”  
WELL, HERE’S MY FIX.  

Let it go.  
Let it go~!  
Can’t hold it back anymore.  

Let it go.  
Let it GO~!  
Twirl away and dance ‘til dawn.  

I don’t care what they’re going to say.  
Yeah, my sword’s still sharp.  
The frills never bothered me anyway.  

It’s funny how some distance makes everything seem small.  
And bidding of my sensei can’t get to me at all.  
It’s time to strike out in the night.  
And, just this once, without a fight.  

Street lights.  
Paved roads.  
No rules for me.  
I’m free.  

LET IT GO.  
LET IT GOOO.  
I AM ONE WITH THE BUSHIDOOO~.  

LET IT GO.  
LET IT GOOO.  
MY BUST IS GREAT, I KNOW.  

IN MY HEELS.  
YOU’LL KNOW HOW I FEEL.  

Yeah, my sword’s still sharp.  
[interlude in which he swings his sword around, dancing in his dress like a ballerina]  

I’ll dance right on the stage for all the crowds.  
They will accept the green and, here to Forks, I’ll be renowned.  

And one thought fills my mind as I sweat and I laugh.  
I’M NEVER GOING BACK.  
The Foot is in the paaaast.  

LET IT GOOO.  
LET IT GOOO.  
And I’ll watch every break of dawn.  

LET IT GO.  
LET IT GO~O~O.  
THAT STUFFY SHELL IS GONE.  

HERE I STAND IN THE LIGHT OF DAY.  
Yeah, my sword’s still SHARP.  
The frills never bothered me anyway.
