#In-Class Writing 2: *No-No Boy*

*This was for Dr. Chamberlain's "Themes of American Literature" class. The theme was masculinity. This writing is undated, but I wrote it sometime between January and March 2014. It's some kind of short reflection on reading* No-No Boy *by John Okada. Dr. Chamberlain thought my topic was an "interesting point," so I assume it was a free write. It's double-spaced on a sheet of lined notebook paper. The first in-class writing was not double-spaced, so I guess I made a mistake there, haha. His main note was "Yes, just try to poiny yo specific language or wording in the text here," and he also wrote "Good work" at the end.* (2020-10-30, before transcription)

*I found a schedule for the class in the front of the binder. It says that this activity was completed on 2014-01-15* (2020-10-30, after transcription)

*No-No Boy* Page 37, "The old man..." paragraph and the following paragraph.

The scene in which Ichiro finds his father reading letters from Japan asking for aid shows the disparity between masculine and feminine ideals in *No-No Boy*. Ichiro's father serves the more feminine roles of the house while his mother is more masculine. This story's take on that places the father as submissive and understanding, almost to a fault, and the mother as overly domineering and stubborn, definitely to a fault. The father who acknowledges that he knows Japan lost the war while the mother denies it ardently, says "It is not for me to say that she is wrong even if I know so," yet this makes him miserable because "I read these letters and drink and cry and drink some more because my own people are suffering so much and there is nothing I can do" (37). He is deferring to the will of the household leader and it is making him miserable. I think the  father's role here and his feelings are meant to be evocative of the feelings of women of the era. There is a certain sense of entrapment there and the masculine figure is being willfully ignorant to protect her world view and her own feelings. She can be overt about it and he must sit alone and drink.
