# In-Class Writing 1: *In Our Time*

*I didn't record the purpose or topic of this assignment, but it's about 3/4 of a page long, so I suspect it was just a free write about* In Our Time *by Ernest Hemingway. Specficially, I chose to write about "Chapter VI", which I remember as a striking section of the book to me, however short it was. I wrote this in Dr. Chamberlain's "Themes of American Literature" class, on one of the first days of class.*

*The notes from Dr. Chamberlain are positive. "Well done, Mike. This shows good thought about the text." "These examples are good one. Just try to cite the page # in the futur. It's not a problem here, but just a good practice to get into generally." I'm pretty sure "Chapter VI" was one page long and I included the page number at the top. Now, I couldn't care less about citation norm culture, so whatever. When I called Nick's gestures a "charade," Dr. Chamberlain noted "Yes, it's a kind of performance really."* (Before transcription, 2020-10-30)

"Chapter VI", Pg. 63

At this point in his life, Nick is fighting in World War I and he has been grievously injured. He is with a fellow soldier, Rinaldi, and he is putting on a brave face, looking "straight ahead and brilliantly." He then turns his head for a moment to speak in a profound manner--as in he believes what he's saying has great meaning and it shows--and when Rinaldi does not respond with affirmations, Nick "turns his head carefully away and" and thinks that "Rinaldi was a disappointing audience." This head tilt towards Rinaldi is Nick trying to live up to the maculine idea that they face adversity head on and sacrifice heroically. When the reality that there's no fanfare in real life hits him, he turns his back on the masculine charade he felt he needed to put up.
