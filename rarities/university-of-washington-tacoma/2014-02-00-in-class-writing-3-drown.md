# In-Class Writing: *Drown*

*I wrote this for Dr. Chamberlain's "Themes of American" literature class
sometime between January and March 2014. I assume these in-class writings were prompted free writes, and this one is labeled a "revision exercise." It's about a short story in* Drown *by Junot Diaz.* (2020-10-30, before transcription)

*Ah, so it was a revision of* my *work. I don't have the earlier version, so I can't verify Dr. Chamberlain's comment "Great work, Mike. This verion is much better than the first. :) Keep up the good work." His other comments were to agree with my thoughts that Diaz's story presented women as objects and that men are primed to think the point of relationships is sexual gratification."*

*This assignment wasn't on the class schedule I found in the front of my binder,
but we read* Drown *in February of that year.* (2020-10-03, after transcription)

Junot Diaz authored the short story "How to Date a Browngirl, Blackgirl, Whitegirl or Halfie," in which he explores how he believes a man is encouraged to think about women and the process of courtship in our society. Throughout, he maintains a minimalist style that made his meaning unclear at times. Nonetheless, the overall thesis was clear: Diaz believes that men are told to consider women as objects to be acted upon and think of sexual gratification as the goal of a relationship meant to be achieved as soon as possible.  would recommend this story because it made me think about my own relationships with women and wonder about what I really wanted out of them. These thoughts were not necessarily comfortable, but they were worth considering and I believe Diasz did a great job of framing his story to bring them about.
