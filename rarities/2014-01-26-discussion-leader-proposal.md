*This was basically the capstone project for "Themes of American Literature," the outline of which I did and turned in 
during the first month because I was an eager beaver of a student then. Frankly, my current situation of feeling unprepared
and disadvantaged because I don't fit a lot of the hallmarks of being "masculine" makes this difficult to read. Even 
though we all know it's bullshit, we feed our "men and boys" with this hero power narrative and it has less than nothing
to do with success in 2018 except as flags that people with these characteristics can use to persuade people biased in favor
of the traits that they are the stronger candidate. But, even then, professional success in 2018 has more to do with
connections, luck, and a compiled history of work that looks perfect from a distance than it does maintaining a masculine
mindset. (2018-11-21)*

# Discussion Leader Proposal 

### 1) Explain the premise 

* **Hemingway’s text, *In Our Time*, is very critical of the way we raise boys to feel like they should be overly heroic. We glorify violent actions, sacrifice, and stoicism.**

    * It most often manifests as the Heroic Artisan archetype, or at least this is what we want it to be. 

* We most often do this through stories. 

    * We **code things in “masculine”** ways, where protagonists have their dream and they beat down the odds, full of bravado and feeling superior because they are the predestined hero. 

    * **Nothing will get in their way that they can’t handle.**

    * For instance, whomever they want will fall in love with them and it’ll be happily ever after. 

    * **This is the coming of age.** It’s treated as a rite of passage that everyone has to go through, but it isn’t real in this form. 

    * **Reality does not work like that.**

    * **Not everything is going to work out.**

    * Why do we do this, convincing young people to believe in this as truth when anyone over a certain age realizes that it’s empty? 

    * A close reading of Hemingway’s text shows this through the Nick Adams stories. 

### 2) Present the evidence 

* **“Indian Camp” is the son watching his father to learn how to act.**

    * The father is posturing for him 

    * Notice that the father shied him away from death. 

* **“The End of Something” shows how this posturing affects his relationships with women negatively.** More generally, the opposite sex. This indoctrination happens for women as well. 

* Nick wants to be Marge’s hero, and he doesn’t want to be with her if he can’t. 

* Love on its own isn’t any fun. Having love is just a facet of him being great. 

* **“Chapter VI” has him shot in the spine and in a dangerous situation where he finally a chance to directly live out the pageantry of the coming of age.**

    * He is focused on posturing himself as rising above his heroic sacrifice and cares more about that than anything else at that moment.  

        * **He just wants to be a man**

    * Rinaldi doesn’t care about it – people don’t – and Nick feels disappointed. 

        * Strychacz’s Hemingway’s masculinity. Nick’s audience is uninterested. 

* **“Big Two-Hearted River” has him on his own** without anyone to posture to around. 

    * **When he does try to show his bravado explicitly, he feels awkward.** When he’s out there, he feels awkward overall, but “professionally happy.” 

    * He has no audience and feels no obligation to do it. 

        * **It’s because that behavior is unrealistic.**

* **He grows from the boy watching his father do this to someone who doesn’t care much for it when he’s on his own.**

### 3) Why is my opinion relevant and worth considering? 

* **Because this mindset still exists.**

* This exaggerated coming of age pervades fiction, which on its own isn’t necessarily a bad thing. 

    * However, it fills people with the notion that they have to live like this. **It influences people’s thinking, for both men and women.**

        * Think about a lot of the major female leads these days. They follow the male coming of age archetype. 

* **The main thing is that this doesn’t prepare us for reality.** Yet we’re still not qualifying it for young people almost a century after In Our Time was published. 

* I don’t know what to do about this, myself, but I think we have to address this as a society somehow. 

### 4) Questions 

* This presentation focused more on the performance side of masculinity. How, if at all, do you think the organic side played a role in Hemingway's stories? How much of our self-centered protagonist culture is innate? 

* Should (or could we) retire the coming of age story, at least in its form presenting dreamy masculinity as factually attainable or good?
