# The Fear and Lonliness of Adolescence

*I found this in another random file. It is hand-written and appears to be either a rough draft or a journaling entry on "Themes and Motifs"
in* The Diary of Anne Frank. *I remember identifying with her then, but I only have vague memories of the book today.*

*Yes, there is a typo in the title and a different typo of the same word in the text. I was not the best speller.*

*Another feature of this is the fact that I clearly wrote almost a whole page and erased it all to restart from the middle of the
first paragraph. The second version may have also been fine, but it was rarely worth destroying what I'd made and making a waste of however
long it took to make it. The impressions are still visible, and it was longer than the version that survived.
I could probably get the last paragraph with an impression. This bad habit isn't a problem anymore because I write almost exclusively in pen.*

The main theme of this diary aside from the war was Anne's Lonlyness as an adolescant stuck in an annex with only her
family, the Van Pels and Mr. Dussel, only one boy her own age  and forced to keep quiet lest she risk being noticed and turned into the
gestapo.

For the people who don't know, this is where the motif comes in.

Anne Frank was constantly afraid that she was going to be caught by the Gustapo. She had to be quiet so she couldn't really discuss her
fear with any one the way she wanted to, full voice, but that made her slightly isolated and another of her fears was to be alone so
she wrote in her diary in a letter format to give herself the thrill of talking as loud as she wanted to.
