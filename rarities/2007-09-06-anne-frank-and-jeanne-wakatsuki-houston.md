# Anne Frank and Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston

*I found this essay in the back of a random folder. I have literally no memory of this. It's untitled.*

*It's from my 8th Grade Language Arts class,
which means I wrote it for Miss Shawley, whom I remember fondly if not specifically. To my shame, I remember two things the most about
her. First, she once bought a book to add to her class library specifically for me because she knew I liked science fiction. (I had
recently discovered the* Star Wars *Expanded Universe, so I was reading a lot of them.) However, I didn't read it because it was in
the middle of the series. I think it
was* The Ships of Earth *by Orson Scott Card. I like Ender, but I don't think I'll be picking up any novels of his outside that series,
even to make up an old debt of honor. The other thing I remember about Miss Shawley is that people always used to romantically pair
her with another teacher, Mr. Goodman. This was inappropriate because Mr. Goodman had a serious girlfiend-if-not-fiance at the time, 
and I'm sure it was very awkward for them. I remember it once being made a big "joke" at an official assembly and it made her so
uncomfortable that she immediately left through the gym's back door. That was fucked up, Keithley, and I thought so at the time.
But, then, what about that school wasn't?*

*Since Mr. Goodman was a math teacher, I won't have a separate place to reflect on him, so while he's on my mind I'll record that I liked
him. He was a very informal, nice man. He taught me algebra in 6th Grade and geometry in 8th. I remember that he wore shorts to work
on what was one of his first days teaching at the school, and I think he got in trouble for it. I also remember one time in 9th Grade
when I had a bathroom emergency after school, so I trespassed on Keithley to relieve myself in one of the building bathrooms.
I ran into him, we had a nice chat, and he didn't report me. That was probably the last time I saw him. This trespassing also happened for the same reason
much later, probably in 11th or 12th Grade, when I ran into my 6th Grade Language Arts teacher, Mrs. Smith. I don't think she recognized
me, which is good, because I think school was in session then, and I was not tight with her. She had a baby in the summer before
my year with her, so we had a sub for the first half, whose name I've forgotten. I remember losing basically all memories of 6th Grade
strangely early, as in by the end of 8th, but I do remember Mrs. Smith was pissed because the sub had us start journaling in the Daybooks
before she returned.*

*Miss Shawley gave this paper 23/25 and wrote "You have some great views and word choices. You threw me off on the paragraph 
I commented on!" She was confused by the second paragraph, where I accidentally combined the two historical figures.* (2019-01-04, before transcribing)

*What the fuck is it with my old history papers and low-to-mid-key downplaying atrocities? Disavowed!*

*I feel like this essay was written with Schaffer paragraphs, but I don't feel like breaking down the TS CD CM CM CD CM CM CS.
That's burned into my skull, even now.*

*There are a few sentences in here like "It was the cleanest slice of hell they had ever seen" that I don't feel like I would
ever write naturally today. My thoughts are always too formal for that kind of random metaphor, but I also feel like that
makes my writing lack spice sometimes. I worry about sounding repetitive with the "Moreover"s and "Firstly"s and whatnot.*

*This is bad, but it was written by a 13-year-old, so whatever. Just confront the apologia, not the weird structure.*

Anne Frank and Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston are very important historical figures. They lived through World War II and have felt
the hypocritical nations that have been their homes their entire lives. However, the level of hypocritical extremes differs
between countries so their situations turned out to be much different.

First off, Jeanne gave herself up to the Americans who demanded their obedience in going to a camp filled with Japanese Americans.
Her father was a fisherman and sent to another camp a few weeks before Jeanne was sent to Manzanar. They hid in squalor in an attic
for two years. They were eventually found and interned  in a camp called Auschwitz and died with the exception of Anne's Father.
The girls in her family were killed by a disease called Typhus which spread like wildfire.

The reasons they were in camps was different as well. America was being either cautious or paranoid by making sure there were no
Japanese spies in America. America sent them to internment camps across the US. Anne was forced to hide from the Gustapo when the 
Nazis took over Holland. The Gustapo were like the police. Hitler, the Nazi leader, just flat out hated Jews and sent them to these
"teaching" camps to kill them. Some died because the closed space made deadly diseases spread at a breakneck pace, some, like Mr. Van Dann,
were gassed, but most died of malnourishment.

Also, their camps were poles apart. In Manzanar the guests were given three square meals of decent food a day. The buildings were also old and
were shanty stables. In Auschwitz, the floors and everything else were spotless, clean, and sanitary. It was the cleanest slice of hell
that the inmates had ever seen. However, the food came regularly but was horrid and looked of vomit.

The stays of Anne and Jeanne were about as reverse as rooster-laying egg. Anne, family and friends, all died with the exception of 
Otto Frank. Jeanne;s family lived as a whole and actually wrote about visiting Manzanar shortly before the book was written. Frankly, 
I think that these people's lives are incomparable.
