# A Short Idea

We talk to each other about nothing every day, so why are we so hesitant to share thoughts?
You may not value an idea because it's not novel, but remember that 
*your experience* is novel. It doesn't matter that someone else said something before;
what do you have to say about it now? What can you add? How could you explain it differently? 
How does your personal brand lend itself to the message?

Ideas are in the Public Domain, and you draw on that as much as the person who wrote the preceding article did.

These 120 words share this idea, and I hope it's beneficial to you.

You can help prove the point by sharing your own short idea.
