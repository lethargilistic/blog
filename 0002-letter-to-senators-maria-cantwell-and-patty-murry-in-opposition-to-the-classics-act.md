# Letter to Senators Maria Cantwell and Patty Murry in Opposition to the CLASSICS Act
(2018-07-08)

As your constituent, I urge you to reject the CLASSICS Act and not extend copyright in a way that hurts the general public. 

Any aging artists who are short on money would be better and more directly served by improvements in our services for the elderly. Extending copyright with the CLASSICS Act will only benefit the corporations that will continue holding their works hostage after their deaths.

Copyright is not the same thing as physical property. It is a temporary government monopoly granted in exchange for creating something original. Fundamentally, it is a bargain struck between the government and the artist. Extending copyright does not make any sense because that benefit was obviously enough for the artist to create the thing in the first place. Refusing to allow works to enter the public domain, whether from the author or the government, is to stand in contempt of the actual intended beneficiary of the copyright system: the public via the public domain. Instead of doing that, you should take a page from our founding fathers and work on shortening copyright term limits.

I realize this concern does not directly address the CLASSICS Act's core purpose, homogenizing the sound recording copyright system, but this bad side effect is a huge poison pill. I'd call it an unintended side effect, but that might be naive, and it needs to be avoided, whether it is a legislative accident or not. And, frankly, these works were made so far in the past that "homogenizing" them seems pointless as they will be public domain anyway in a relatively few years. They should have entered the public domain long ago, and that will certainly simplify the streaming rights.

I look forward to learning more about your position on this issue.

Thank you.
