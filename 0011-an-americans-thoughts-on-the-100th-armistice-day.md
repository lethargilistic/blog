# An American's Thoughts on the 100th Armistice Day

(2018-11-11)

When I was little, World War I was always my favorite war&mdash;what an American
sentiment that is. When Americans speak of war, it is almost universally in the
admiration of past glories, where we entered late and immediately began
relitigating history to cast ourselves as singular heroes. To that end, our
cultural memory fixates on the "great" acts of war we committed. Lost in this
glory-seeking revisionism is the scale of destruction in the months between
those select moments. Millions die in those gaps, but they're just numbers.
Instead, we selectively recall the terrible things done to us without any 
self-awareness of the similarities to what we do to them, and neglect the rest.

It's a shame that I have to turn to World War II for the analogy, but we
remember Pearl Harbor and dropping the bomb on Hiroshima in keen detail, less
the completely, utterly unjustifiable bombing of Nagasaki. We don't even seem to
care about the Hundred Days Offensive, and somehow care even less about the
world-altering battles we sat out of, think the Somme or Verdun. Consequently,
there's an insurmountable distance between the American and the European
understanding of war. War is abstract to us, and real to them. 
We developed a huge-ass bomb and dropped it on civilians thousands of miles
away. They spend months digging intricate underground labyrinths underneath
enemy lines in order to plant powerful mines so close to the surface that they
had to "dig" by chipping off small bits of dirt and catch it in their hands so
as to not alert the enemy. They tried to make sure they were always digging the
tunnels upwards so as to allow the blood and jellied corpses from those who got
caught to seep down and alert the living that a particular shaft had been
compromised. Then they activated those mines and, where there were
previously base camps, they created craters that remain today. Some are now
lakes.

And, of course, no matter how we visualize the horrors of wars like the
Great War in Europe, we are still repeating the war mistake and selling it to
subsequent generations as a source of valor. Only, we latched on to World War II
because its aims were so clear. We shrug off the reasons for World War I because
they were so opaque even at the time, and have done so for every major conflict
the United States has been involved with since then. 

Hell, we don't even call Armistice Day "Armistice Day," preferring the
abstract "Veteran's Day" as if that alone doesn't make us hypocrites every time
we say "Never Forget." We have already forgotten. It's common in many war
stories I've read that involved the "home front," so to speak, that the
women, children, old, and otherwise non-combatants would crowd around and
discuss the news of the war as though it were happening next door. I ask my
fellow Americans to try and see if they even remember the last time they heard
about a specific battle or happening in the War in Afghanistan. I can't.
I looked at Wikipedia the other day and saw a [list of battles I don't even
remotely recognize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Afghanistan_War), and
they don't seem to have any impact on anyone else over here aside from the vague
acknowledgment that we remain involved in the longest war in American history.
Perhaps that's because we don't know how to make the stories of soldiers' deaths
exciting enough for TV anymore. Perhaps that's because we've finally recognized
that there is nothing particularly glamorous about the reality of war even as we
continue to wage it worldwide and plea moral justification. 

Regardless, we've turned our backs on the men and women fighting the Forever War
we've already forgotten.
