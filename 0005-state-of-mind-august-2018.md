# State of Mind: August 2018

(Cut preamble to an article)

These days, during my time spent distracting myself from the woes of
unemployment, I often contribute to organizations dedicated to spreading
knowledge or media with the world, specifically Wikipedia and LibriVox. It's
a mostly low-key affair where I don't run into people constantly questioning my
ability to exist in the industry I've trained to join for 7 years while
quickly ushering in people who've learned one framework. I don't have
a problem with the latter, because the difficulty of most software development
is severely overhyped in service of established folks' egos, but my position is
certainly demoralizing. So it helps to feel like I'm positively contributing to
the world in whatever small corners I can. Right now that means raising
awareness of the bleak state of American and, certainly, international copyright
law.
