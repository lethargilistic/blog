# The Wookieepedia April Fools’ Day Controversy

(2014-05-03, [thenerdemp.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20150328050520/http://thenerdemp.com/the-wookieepedia-controversy/))

*I wrote this to protest an incident where Wookieepedia made a horrifically sexist April Fools' Day "joke" at the expense of women.
Wookieepedia was taken over by a cadre of assholes who promoted their asshole friends during my several years 
of contributing to the site, and as far as I've seen, they're still there being tyrants. Looking back on it, the controversy over the Breast article&mdash;namely, their fight to keep it in the face of everyone saying what they did was shitty&mdash;was a great example of how myopic nerd fiefdoms and wikis in particular get. They train their members to think only in terms of their internal rules and customs, as if their site exists in a vacuum, even though the site exists to serve people outside of that vacuum. You can see that in how many times Wookieepedians responded to the incident by saying a variation of "breasts are canon," as if that were even remotely a response to the outrage or a mitigating factor that would quelch that outrage among anyone who wasn't already a Wookieepedian insider.*

*I didn't think this article was particularly well-written at the time, but it is a unique source for a number of insider links about the incident. To this day in 2018, the official post about [the 2014 April Fools' Day "joke"](https://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Wookieepedia:April_Fools'_Day_2014) does not link to [the official statement](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Wookieepedia:April_Fools'_Day_2014/Statement) about it (a textbook non-apology), so you have to know that it exists to find it.*

-----

My name is Mike Overby and I joined Wookieepedia in 2008, when I was thirteen. At the time, I did not know that googling my username, [NaruHina](https://web.archive.org/web/20150328050520/http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/User:NaruHina), would turn back porn, I was so young. I first contributed to Wikia’s *Naruto* site. By the time I realized that, I had been a regular editor of Wookieepedia for some time and changing my name wasn’t really an option. In the almost six years since, I’ve put a frightening amount of time into the site, but I decided somewhat recently to (mostly) retire because it just didn’t feel as fun as it used to.

But I’m not here to talk about me. I’m here to respond to the April Fool’s Day joke, from an insider perspective. In case you didn’t hear (since I didn’t until the Fourth), part of this’s year’s festivities was to use the [Breast article](https://web.archive.org/web/20150328050520/http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Breast) as the Featured Article on the Main Page. As if that were not bad enough – and I will get to why that is worse than you think, in a moment – [the part that would appear on the main page](https://web.archive.org/web/20150328050520/http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Wookieepedia:April_Fools%27_Day_2014/Breast) was edited to be as sexist as possible. You can read reactions from prominent Star Wars fan sites, [Club Jade](https://web.archive.org/web/20150328050520/http://clubjade.net/?p=57599) and [Toshe Station](https://web.archive.org/web/20150328050520/http://tosche-station.net/wookieepedias-apology-falls-well-short/). As should be needless to say, this was met with righteous outcry.

A lot of Star Wars fans, including myself, have been calling for more starring female characters. The vast majority of primary protagonists in the Star Wars universe are men. That is not to say that there are no stories starring women as the main character, but there are far fewer. Add to that that most of these characters (men and women) are white and you have a big issue. It’s at the point where I saw people outside the fandom covering a yellow non-human woman as a “Woman of Color.” Star Wars cannot afford to get off that easy. Zeltrons are pink. They are not people of color. Off the top of my head, I can think of Mace Windu, Lando Calrissian, ~~Tendra Calrissian~~ (wife) (Update: [who is actually white](https://web.archive.org/web/20150328050520/http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Tendra_Risant_Calrissian); my mistake), Lando Calrissian, Jr. (son he had when he was in his 70s), Mandalore the Vindicated, and Quinlan Vos. Notice how many of those characters are related? How many are men? Problem. [That’s not even getting into the issue of how women, specifically, are depicted.](https://web.archive.org/web/20150328050520/http://clubjade.net/?p=37452)

Now, why is this even worse than poking that bear, which *everyone* involved knew about, by the way?

Let me tell you why the Breast article exists, and why I voted to keep it.

It was not kept as a joke. The will of the community, which has always been welcoming of women, was to keep it. People joked about keeping it because we knew that there would be objections, and that was never right, but the reasons for keeping it were sober ones. It was not because breasts are funny.

The top image is very nice artwork, representative of the subject, and not sexual. Wookieepedia was not to use the image in a sexual way. Ever. [This was the reason given to and accepted by *Wikia’s top brass*](https://web.archive.org/web/20150328050520/http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Forum:SH:Aayla_Secura_and_Wikia%27s_TOU) after the company changed its Terms of Use to be more strict about these sorts of things. **The breast image is only there because of a special exemption.**

The subject of breasts can be treated in a serious way, and is on the actual breast page. They are neither fetishized nor covered less clinically than anything else. Virtually all Wookieepedians have defended the breast page time and time again, including the female editors, with this trust as the prime condition.

That trust has been broken in a horrible way. One of, if not the most, horrible ways possible: presenting it as the April Fools’ Day joke that, traditionally, has had [thought](https://web.archive.org/web/20150328050520/http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Wookieepedia:April_Fools%27_Day_2008) [put](https://web.archive.org/web/20150328050520/http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Wookieepedia:April_Fools%27_Day_2009) [into](https://web.archive.org/web/20150328050520/http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Wookieepedia:April_Fools%27_Day_2010) [it](https://web.archive.org/web/20150328050520/http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Wookieepedia:April_Fools%27_Day_2011).

I don’t care if [Wookieepedia’s official response](https://web.archive.org/web/20150328050520/http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Wookieepedia:April_Fools%27_Day_2014/Statement) says that few people were involved – **the person who posted it had to be [an administrator](https://web.archive.org/web/20150328050520/http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Wookieepedia:Featured_article_queue/Week_14,_2014/0?oldid=4813670), by the way. Wookieepedia should reprimand him publicly, especially since his maturity was [the primary reason cited by those of us who opposed his adminship.](https://web.archive.org/web/20150328050520/http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Wookieepedia:Requests_for_user_rights/RFA_archive/JangFett)** Even if I entertained the fantasy that this was one child ruining something for everybody else, that trust in the treatment of this article can never be regained.

The only thing for Wookieepedia to do at this stage is to delete the Breast article. Then, maybe we can get a real apology, with a *mea culpa* for the [glaring non-apology](https://web.archive.org/web/20150328050520/http://tosche-station.net/wookieepedias-apology-falls-well-short/) of an official statement. Then Darth Culator, ~~an administrator~~ a bureaucrat (representing the maximum user rights and a step above administrator), can apologize for [removing Club Jade from the Official Friends list without authorization and calling the site’s reaction a “bitchfest.”](https://web.archive.org/web/20150328050520/http://starwars.wikia.com/index.php?title=Template:Mainpage-friends&diff=4817343&oldid=4816224) (Update: [Darth Culator deleted the revision, which means that the record is hidden.](https://web.archive.org/web/20150328050520/http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Special:Log/delete?page=Template:Mainpage-friends) No apology.) Then everyone who responded to this issue [*like this*](https://web.archive.org/web/20171008131804/http://clubjade.net/why-the-wookieepedia-article-on-breasts-is-a-big-deal/#comment-63198) can publicly apologize. (Cade is not an administrator, but he damn well better apologize, too.)

Then maybe things can get back to normal. Things can be thought through next time.

As much as this means, coming from a mostly retired Wookieepedian, I am terribly sorry for our community. This was terrible, and I am glad that people reacted in this way.

The Wayback Machine didn't save the image, so it's lost, but I'm pretty sure the video (Charlie Brown parents' "Womp Womp Womp") was accurate. Don't trust things on the Internet to survive, kids!*
