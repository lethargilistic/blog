* On the value of old tweets. What did I think of hot button issues years ago? Why preservation of tweets important because microblogging replaces journaling. Don't delete tweets.
*  On the deposit requirement's extreme importance for software. Copyright does not incentivise software companies to create or do research and development. It incentivises them to restrict access to its developments. After all, we consider the binaries copyrighted and that is why we cannot share software amongst each other, but the binaries are not the original article and are not something that people could learn anything from. The code is. If we do not compel them to release the code, then we can't charge people with copyright infringement for writing similar logic because there is no. Suitably, if the software code is not released, there is no benefit in treating it as federally copyrighted simply because it exists because nobody will ever learn from it. Imagine if the copyright system were applied to books. Software companies demand that they receive the full restriction abilities of copyright, but they avoid the portions of the law that actually "promote the progess of science and useful arts". They have the legal authority to do this, as the law stands, but not a right to do this. But perhaps they really think that the code is common law copyrighted, not federal?
